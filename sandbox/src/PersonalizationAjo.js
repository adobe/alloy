      <p>
        This page tests rendering of activities using an AJO surface. If you
        navigated here from another sandbox view, you will probably need to
        refresh your browser because this is how to properly simulate a non-SPA
        workflow.

        This is the AJO personalization placeholder. Personalized content has
        not been loaded.
