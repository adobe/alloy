/**
 * This is the code, once minified, that an Alloy consumer copies and pastes
 * into their website's HTML. It sets up any global functions the consumer will
 * use to interact with Alloy. It also provides a queuing mechanism whereby
 * any function calls made by the consumer before the Alloy library file
 * loads will be enqueued and later processed by Alloy once the Alloy library
 * file has loaded. Because each call may be asynchronously processed, a promise
 * will always be returned to the consumer any time the consumer attempts to
 * execute a command.
 *
 * Along with this base code, a script tag (not shown here) will also be added
 * to the consumer website's HTML that will load the Alloy library file.
 *
 * Take particular care to write well-minifiable code, as consumers are
 * particularly sensitive to base code size.
