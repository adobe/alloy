      While it seems reasonable to use re-use our default test page
      and just add the meta CSP element dynamically during our test,
      TestCafe has a bug that prevents that approach from working properly.

      A customer using a CSP would typically add a nonce attribute to
      the base code script we provide in Alloy's installation instructions.
      Then, Alloy would find the nonce on that script tag and use the
      nonce value when adding script or style elements (typically when
      rendering personalized content). Because TestCafe limits how the
      base code's script tag is constructed
      (https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/5612), we can't add
      a nonce attribute to the script tag that TestCafe adds to the page.
      So, as a workaround, we've provided this script tag with a nonce, so that
      Alloy can properly access and use its nonce value.
