// - It implements all lifecycle hooks.

// Let's start the first version with an explicit Hook interface,
// and not a random pub/sub model. Meaning each Component will have
// to implement the hook it's interested in as a method on its prototype.

// We will have a Plop helper that generates Components and populate all the
// hooks as Template methods.

// TODO: Finalize the first set of Lifecycle hooks. (DONE)
// TODO: Support Async hooks. (Or maybe default them as Async)
// TODO: Hooks might have to publish events so the outside world can hooks in as well.

// MAYBE: If a Component has a hard dependency, maybe throw an error somewhere:
// if (componentRegistry.hasComponent('Personalization')) {
//  new Error() or core.missingRequirement('I require Personalization');
// }
