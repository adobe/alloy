   * multiple ECIDs being minted for the user. Once we get an identity
   * cookie, we can let the queued requests be sent all at once, since they
   * will have the newly minted ECID.
   *
   * Konductor should make every effort to return an identity, but in
   * certain scenarios it may not. For example, in cases where the
   * request does not match what Konductor is expecting (ie 400s).
   * In cases where Konductor does not set an identity, there should be
   * no events recorded so we don't need to worry about multiple ECIDs
   * being minted for each user.
   *
   * The reason we allow for multiple sequential requests to be sent without
   * an identity is to prevent a single malformed request causing all other
   * requests to never send.
